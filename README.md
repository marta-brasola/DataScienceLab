# Exploring Comprehensive Human Development: Beyond Economics and Education



## Abstract 

The following report aims to show a comprehensive analysis of the human development index compared to other indices proposed by the United Nations Developing Program. Such indices are mainly focused on modern issues such as environment, gender inequalities, and wealth disproportions. The data take all the countries of the world in a date span from 1990 to 2021 showing the indices at each date. The primary objective of this study is to find the latent relations between the HDI and all the others to propose a new set of indices describing a nation’s well-being. We are searching for a more complete understanding of the quality of life in a state, regarding not only the economics or schooling factors but focusing on more modern problems. To conduct this analysis, we carefully consider the semantics of each indicator and comprehend to the fullest all the aspects of it. To achieve this, we exploit statistical learning techniques to understand correlations and outliers. We hope to find some form of positive correlation between HDI and “green indicators” and likes with inequality factors.

## Research Questions

- What are the latent relations between the Human Development Index (HDI) and other indices proposed by the United Nations Developing Program?
- Can a new set of indices be proposed to comprehensively describe a nation's well-being beyond traditional measures like HDI?
- Is there a more complete understanding of the quality of life in a state possible by considering modern issues in addition to economic and educational factors?
- Are there correlations between HDI and "green indicators," and are there correlations with factors related to inequality?

## Data

We used the data of HDI index only for 2021
