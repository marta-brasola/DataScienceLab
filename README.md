# Exploring Comprehensive Human Development: Beyond Economics and Education



## Abstract 

The following report aims to show a comprehensive analysis of the human development index compared to other indices proposed by the United Nations Developing Program. Such indices are mainly focused on modern issues such as environment, gender inequalities, and wealth disproportions. The data take all the countries of the world in a date span from 1990 to 2021 showing the indices at each date. The primary objective of this study is to find the latent relations between the HDI and all the others to propose a new set of indices describing a nation’s well-being. We are searching for a more complete understanding of the quality of life in a state, regarding not only the economics or schooling factors but focusing on more modern problems. To conduct this analysis, we carefully consider the semantics of each indicator and comprehend to the fullest all the aspects of it. To achieve this, we exploit statistical learning techniques to understand correlations and outliers. We hope to find some form of positive correlation between HDI and “green indicators” and likes with inequality factors.

## Research Questions

- What are the latent relations between the Human Development Index (HDI) and other indices proposed by the United Nations Developing Program?
- Can a new set of indices be proposed to comprehensively describe a nation's well-being beyond traditional measures like HDI?
- Is there a more complete understanding of the quality of life in a state possible by considering modern issues in addition to economic and educational factors?
- Are there correlations between HDI and "green indicators," and are there correlations with factors related to inequality?

## Data

## Results 

- Exploration of Indices: The study explored various indices related to human development, emphasizing the significance of certain metrics over others.
- Correlation Analysis: Identified a spectrum of correlations among metrics, prompting questions about the necessity and redundancy of components in the HDI computation.
- Introduction of RHDI: Introduced the Reformed Human Development Index (RHDI) as an alternative to HDI, relying on life expectancy and income while excluding education to address concerns about entanglement.
- Comparative Analysis: Conducted a comparative analysis between HDI and RHDI, revealing less pronounced correlations between RHDI and HDI compared to their correlations with other metrics.
- Shifts in Country Positions: RHDI showed a significant shift in the positions of countries, indicating the potential bias introduced by the entanglement of education with economic factors.
- Comprehensive Index Development: Developed a comprehensive index incorporating environmental indicators, CO2 emissions, ecological footprint, and GII, providing a more nuanced perspective on well-being.
- Global Disparities: Highlighted significant disparities in developing nations, particularly in pollution, women's rights, and overall well-being, calling for global attention to address these critical issues.
